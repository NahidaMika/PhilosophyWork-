#### A) **My relationship with nature.** 

1. **If saltillo lost a mountain of Zapaliname, what happening?**
> *Humans may be deforesting the trees in the mountain, because of that animals escape from there*.	

2. **Which objects are neccesary in my daily life?**
> *Water, food, cellphone(maybe).*

3. **Should resources such as clean air have a cost?**
> *No resources like clean air shouldn't have any cost, because the companies would build a monopoly on those resources.*

4. **How can we promote a deep and respectful connection with nature?**
> *By inviting people to hike in a mountain or going out with the nature.*

5. **What responsibilities do I have for a limited resources?**
> *To do not wast unnecessary resources.*

6. **Saltillo was known for its perfect climate. What changes altered this reality?**
> *Human kind, that made global warming, that causes the climate to change on time.*	

7. **How would our relationship with the environment change if we adopted an ecocentric perspective?**
> *We would see the have more things related to the nature.*

#### B) **Glosary.** 
##### Make a detailed consultation on the next concepts.

- **Biodiversity**: 
> Is the variety of all life forms on Earth. It includes all living organisms, their genes, and the ecosystem of which they are part. This diversity exists at different scales, including species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity.
	 
- **Sustainability**:
> Is the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
	
- **Ecocentrism**:
> Philosophical and ethical viewpoint that places intrinsic value on all living organisms and their natural environment, regardless of their usefulness to humans. This worldview advocates for prioritizing the well-being of ecosystems and nonhuman life, often in opposition to purely human-centered interests.
	
- **Consumerism**:
> Social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services or as a movement for protecting consumers' interests.  

- **Anthropocentrism**:
> The belief that humans are the most important and central entity in the universe. This ethical viewpoint holds that humans alone have intrinsic value, while all other beings and objects are valuable only for their usefulness to humans (instrumental value).

- **Astronomy**:
> Natural science dedicated to the study of celestial objects and phenomena that occur beyond Earth's atmosphere. This includes everything from the planets and stars visible to the naked eye to distant galaxies and dark matter . It uses the principles from physics, chemistry, ad mathematics to explain the origin and evolution of these objects and phenomena.

- **Cosmology**:
> Branch of astronomy that focuses on the study of the universe as a whole. It investigates the universe's origin, large-scale structure, evolution and ultimate fate. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang Theory, which posits that the universe began as a dense and hot state and has been expanding for billions of years.

- **Etiology**:
> Is the study of causation or the origin of something. The term is commonly used in medicine to refer to the study if the causes and origins of a disease or abnormal condition. In other fields, such as philosophy, biology, and cosmology, it refer more generally to the reasons or factors behind a particular phenomenon.

- **Causal**:
> An adjective that relates to or constitutes a cause. If there is a causal relationship between two things, it means that one is responsible for the other. The term describes a connection between cause and effect.

#### C) **Watch the next video**. "Como los lobos cambiaron el curso de los rios"

1.  How does this history reflect the antropocentric view of nature?
> It shows that human intervention in nature is good for a ecological balance, often seen as a restoration of human-caused damage.

2. What do you think about the idea that human beings have a moral obligation to restore ecological balance?
> Humans could have a moral obligation to restore the balance because it has a capacity to make informed decisions and act upon them, taking responsibility of past mistakes.

3. Based on the video, how did the reintroduction demonstrate the natural resilience of the environment?
> When the wolves were reintroduced to the ecosystem, it shows a chain reaction of positives changes, revitalizing the ecosystem and reversing negatives impacts caused by their absence.

#### D) **Copernican turn.**
1. Make a synoptic chart about the Copernican turn according to Kant.

| Aspect                                 | Pre-Kantian                                                                                                      | Kantioan                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Role of experience                     | The source of all knowledge, but its conclusion cannot be certain or universal (Hume).                           | All knowledge begins *with* experience, but doesn't arise  *from* experience alone. The mind's a priori forms organize empirical data.                                                                 |
| Nature of space and time               | Space and time are real, objective features of the external world (Newton).                                      | Space and time are not properties of things-in-themselves but are subjective, a priori "forms of intuitition" inherent to the human mind. We can only experience objects as a being in space and time. |
| Source of Objectivity and Universality | Found in objects themselves, whose properties exist independently of the knowing subject.                        | Found in the universal and necessary structure of the human mind, which imposes order on experience.                                                                                                   |
| Relationship between Mind and Object   | The mind is a passive recipient of information, and its representations must conform to the objects of the wold. | The mind is an active constructor of knowledge. Objects must conform to the mind's inherent a priori structures.                                                                                       |

2. "Reality is discovered, not constructed: what we know about the world comes entirely from the properties of external objects." Do you agree or disagree with this argument?
> I agree with this argument, because the reality you are in is only conformed by the things you know about and if you don't know about something it doesn't conform into your reality.
